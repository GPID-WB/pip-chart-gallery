Note: The map presents Gini indexes for the latest available survey (after 2000), which measures the inequality of income or consumption, depending on the economy. High-inequality economies have a Gini index above 40, moderate-inequality economies are those with a Gini index between 30 and 40, and low-inequality economies are those with a Gini index below 30.
