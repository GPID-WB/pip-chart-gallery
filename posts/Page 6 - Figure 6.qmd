Note: Poverty rates are shown relative to 2019 levels for the \$3.00 and \$8.30 per person per day poverty lines (expressed in 2021 PPP dollars). Population coverage is less than 50 percent of the group's population for low-income countries in 2019 and 2024, and for middle-income countries in 2019. The estimates after 2024 are nowcasts. High-income countries are omitted because poverty rates are small. Income group is kept fixed using the fiscal year 2026 classifications.
