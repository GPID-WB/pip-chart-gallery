Note: Poverty rates are reported for the \$3.00, \$4.20, and \$8.30 per person per day poverty lines (expressed in 2021 PPP dollars). Poverty is projected after 2024 based on per capita GDP growth projections in the June 2025 Global Economic Prospects complemented by the April 2025 Macro Poverty Outlook and the World Economic Outlook. The black horizontal line indicates the World Bank Group’s target for 3% extreme poverty by 2030.
