Note: Poverty rates are shown relative to 2019 levels for the $8.30 per person per day poverty line (expressed in 2021 PPP dollars). The line for low-income countries is dotted because the surveys cover less than 50 percent of the group's population between 2019 and 2022. The estimates after 2024 are nowcasts. High-income countries are omitted because poverty rates are small. Income group is kept fixed using the fiscal year 2024 classifications.
